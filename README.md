# GraphLinq.Locales

Translations for the GraphLinq Analytics Platform!

## How It Works

- Create a folder in the main directory with the abbreviation: [List of abbreviations](https://github.com/ladjs/i18n-locales)

- To help you get started - you can copy and paste the `translation.json` and `welcome.json` from the `en` folder into your new directory.

- `welcome.json` contains a list of all the phrases that need to be translated into the local language. Your file should look exactly like mine but on the right side of each item should be the translated term.

- `translation.json` contains a list of all the languages supported and how they would apear in that folders language. We will all need to keep adding to our lists as new langauges are added.

- IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS - JUST ASK!

If you were adding `zz`, it should look like this.

```text
.
├── en
│   ├── welcome.json
│   └── translation.json
├── de
│   └── welcome.json
|   └── translation.json
├── fr
│   ├── welcome.json
│   └── translation.json
├── zz
│   ├── welcome.json
│   └── translation.json
```

## Formating Guildlines

The documents are in [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON).

Please leave an empty line at the end of the document.

The last line of a set of parameters does not have a `,` comma at the end of it!

## Changes

Please do not add any new fields to the document unless we discuss.

## Special Thanks

After you submit a translation - credit will be given here!
